# Description
WeatherApp is a simple web application that lets users check the current weather conditions in any city around the world. The app fetches weather data from a fake API using JavaScript's fetch() method, and displays it on the DOM in a user-friendly way.

Upon launching the app, users are prompted to enter the name of the city they want to check the weather for. The app then makes a request to the fake API using the fetch() method, passing the city name as a parameter in the API endpoint URL. The API responds with weather data for the specified city in JSON format.

The app then parses the JSON data using JavaScript's built-in JSON.parse() method, and extracts the relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. It then dynamically generates a weather report card using HTML and CSS, and populates it with the extracted weather data.

It is a single page application.
